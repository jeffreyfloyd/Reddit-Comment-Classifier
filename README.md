# Can we determine if a reddit user found a post satisfying or infuriating?
More specifically can we determine if a user posted their comment on r/oddlysatisfying or r/mildlyinfuriating using NLP?

The goal of this project is to try and create a machine learning algorithm that can read comment data on reddit and classify the subreddit from which that data came from. This project will only be looking at the two previously mentioned subreddits. It will start by using the Pushshift.io Reddit API to collect comments from the r/oddlysatisfying and r/mildlyinfuriating subreddits. After cleaning and feature engineering, data will be run through logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models to try and predict which subreddit a comment was posted on.

# Primary findings
Able to achieve a prediction accuracy of at best 76% of the time with logistic regression and at worst 72% with random forest classifier (baseline score to beat was 50%). All models slighly overfit in their current state. There are some clear patterns for comments on each subreddit but more work needs to be done to increase accuracy.

# Potential Updates
- Further tuning of stop words to reduce overfitting and increase accuracy for all models
- Moving to cloud computing platforms to be able to perform operations on larger amounts of data
- Creation of a streamlit application to get live predictions of comment subreddit origin
