Andr3aJones13,"We had a boxer crossed with a border collie, had the colour and the strength/muscle in his body of a boxer, esp. his back legs. 

Looked more like a border collie in the face and markings.

He was so intelligent, knew he want allowed on dad's chair so at 4.55pm he would get off the chair and into his bed,  and when dad came in would smile at him wagging his tail at his baby gate (he wasn't allowed in the livingroom alone).  

As soon as he would go to sit down be would see dog hair. 

Also he loved laser pointers, one day my bro thought it would be funny to point it on the wall then turn it off, so the dog went into the livingroom to wait for it. Not so smart that one in a way. 

Another time my family was on holiday and i bought him one of those hide chews in the shape of a shoe. He was out in the garden for ages,  i went out and asked where it was,  he had buried it, so i took it out and gave it to him, he looked at me in disgust and i went back in with him chewing on it.

Again went out and he had this time almost but not quite put a plastic plant pot over it, the look he gave me was priceless when i went to uncover it.  So i left it. 

Part of the reason we would not let him bury it in the mud is in the UK it rains a lot and he would wait till it was mouldy and soggy and disgusting then dig it up and bring it in. 

He once started hacking up in his bed, i thought he was going to cough something he'd buried up... nope.. a live frog.

I'm not making a good case for intelligence am i üòÇ

    When the last scene of my life shot before me I looked back at the footprints in the sand. There was only one set of pawprints. I realized that this was at the lowest and saddest times of my life. This always bothered me and I questioned the dog about my dilemma.

    ""Dog, You told me when I decided to adopt You, You would walk and bark with me all the way. But I'm aware that during the most troublesome times of my life there is only one set of pawprints. I just don't understand why, when I need You most, You leave me.""

HeliosRX,"NaCH3COO (Liquid) -&gt; NaCH3COO (Solid). No intramolecular bonds are being broken or formed in this, so it‚Äôs a physical reaction, not a chemical one. It's the Sodium Acetate freezing solid. 

There are two concepts to think about regarding this process: Enthalpy and Entropy.

Molecules like to go towards their lowest-energy state, because it's the most stable. Liquids have weaker intermolecular forces between their molecules, which leads to a higher energy state. Going from high to low energy states releases the difference in energy as heat. Therefore a liquid freezing is exothermic. We call this energy difference Enthalpy, which is often written out as delta H. Delta is the capitalized 4th letter of the Greek alphabet and represents the difference in a value. 

Molecules also tend to want to put themselves in the most chaotic, unordered state possible. The universe doesn't like ordered structures, so it tends to prefer whatever state has the least amount of organization. A solid tends to have a fixed, organized structure which is less preferable than liquid or gaseous states. This preference tends to be temperature dependent, as the more kinetic energy a molecule has, the more chances it has to throw itself around and create an overall unordered state. Entropy is often phrased as T (temperature) times delta S (entropy). 

These two phenomena are responsible for determining the freezing and boiling points of materials. Enthalpy prefers solid &gt; liquid &gt; gas while entropy prefers gas &gt; liquid &gt; solid. Whichever is more energetically favorable wins out at a given temperature. This is known as the Gibbs Free Energy, delta G, and is represented by the equation delta G = delta H ‚Äì T delta S. This is the net amount of energy released in a reaction. Whenever that energy equals zero, you have equilibrium between two phases of matter.

Normally, a material will freeze at its equilibrium temperature, the melting point. It generally refuses to budge from that temperature until the freeze is complete, because any attempt to put more energy to the system just goes towards freezing the material faster. However, sodium acetate is somewhat unusual in that it can stay liquid under the freezing temperature of the material, a phenomenon known as supercooling. When we press the coin in the heating pouch, you force a few of the molecules in the pack into a small crystal of solid, which then causes the rest of the pack to rapidly crystalize around it and turn itself into a fully solid state. Because the temperature of the pack is so far below its melting point, the T delta S term is smaller than it would be at the melting point. Beause delta H remains the same, delta G is not zero and the system is not in equilibrium, so the pack releases a lot of heat to the surrounding environment and attempts to rapidly raise its temperature to the melting point of sodium acetate, roughly 58C. This is at or just below the burning temperature of skin, which is very convenient for us as it‚Äôs safe as a result.",1636130995,oddlysatisfying

kmsilent,"The reusability is what sold me, I don't like generating a bunch of trash everywhere I go.

If you (or a friend) ride motorcycles or bikes, they are a really fantastic gift. I actually consider mine an essential piece of safety gear - you need warm hands for proper control, and if you ever find yourself with really chilly hands (ie waking up from camping or just a random cold spell) they are fantastic. Just a few minutes to warm up your hands and you are good to go. 

Also, if you put cold hands into motorcycle gloves and start riding, you may never warm up - at least for me, I think my body sometimes decides to stop trying to warm up my hands. Put warm hands into gloves and they typically stay warm.
