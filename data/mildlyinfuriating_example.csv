JaninnaMaynz,"I'd probably add 2 more tenders and a serving of veggies. As is, it might tide a student over until after school, but most high schoolers will still be hungry. I certainly was, and I've never weighed more than 142lb. Very much a healthy BMI. In school I think I maxed out at 128 or so. When I was purposely trying to gain weight. (I don't know why. I attribute that to dumb kid brain. I didn't want to be fat or anything, I just wanted an extra 10 pounds because... reasons.)

BMGreg,"&gt;Yeah, I find it to be crude and exceptionally dull. It's like the word ""very"" - it's best to avoid using it and try to be more eloquent.

Great. Use your creative mind and come up with something else. I personally find it best to avoid offending groups of people whenever possible. It's generally more eloquent.

&gt;I guess I fail to see how ""asperger's level honest"" is insulting to people with asperger's. It's just a fact... 

Well for one, not everyone with Asperger's behaves this way. As mentioned, some people work very hard to study social cues and practice being socially aware. A text message is a perfect place for anyone to be mindful about what they are saying. For two, at least 2 people have told you that it's disrespectful/rude now. The point is ""autistic level honest"" is what's insulting. You are associating a negative trait with this guy and saying that his negative trait is so bad, it qualifies as autistic. 

Perhaps you don't mean to be insulting and that's fine. If that's the case, please just rethink defending people using autism as a slur. 

&gt;And who would it be insulting to? Me, sure, but thats the intention

So when we transfer the analogy back to reality, calling someone""autistic level"" would be intended as an insult to them, right? This whole thing is implying that ""autistic level honest"" is meant to be an insult. It's only insulting is being autistic is bad. 

&gt;I don't see anything wrong with the statement ""man, this is some asperger's level type honesty, it has no tact or empathy"".
&gt;&gt;it has no tact or empathy

It's just not necessary. There are other ways to word it. I don't get why you're stuck on insisting it's autistic. Just pick another word. You have millions to choose from. It's really not that hard to be a slightly better person and just learn from this. 

For example:
His honesty was embarrassingly painful.
He was so blunt, stoners loved him.
Man, I bet he wishes he had thought through that text before he sent it.
That text was so brutally honest, I almost feel bad for him.
I'm like 95% sure that you're capable of finding at least one other way to phrase it without using the word autistic",1636144736,mildlyinfuriating

Leszachka,"Mmm, ""high in protein"" is a vague term that gets thrown around a lot in plant-based nutrition discussions and doesn't actually cover all of the important information. This is not to call you out specifically, but I'm just going to dump some information here and hope it doesn't come across weird, because I get a lot of my protein from plant sources, but realistically, many sources like peanuts and other nuts are SUPER high in fat calories per gram of protein, and legumes are high in carb calories. That doesn't mean these foods are unhealthy or bad; they're great! It just means that ""high in protein"" doesn't mean the same thing for vegan sources as it does for animal sources.

To illustrate: 49g of protein per day is the RDA for a sedentary, average woman. Some people can do well with less than this, but others don't. I don't.

For 75g of protein, which is higher than the sedentary baseline but is an extremely reasonable female lifting day goal, you would consume about 300g of peanuts, at 1700 calories total. To get the same amount of protein, you would consume around 390g of lean ground turkey (weighed raw) for 515 calories, or 250g of boneless skinless chicken breast for 378 calories.

Obviously, no one is going to eat all of their daily calories in peanuts, and for those of you who may try, godspeed and please consider a bidet. It's just presented as a comparison.

For me, 1700 calories is already a slight weight gain number on most days, and I'm a statistically average height with a statistically average baseline metabolism. That means that to get adequate protein to sustain modest progress in lifting, while maintaining my same weight, all of my food for that entire day would have to be as good or even slightly better than peanuts in terms of macro balance. It's very hard to get training macros in a whole food based, calorically appropriate vegetarian or vegan diet plan compared to a plan with animal sources. 

Happily, the market in refined plant protein sources like pea protein powder is rapidly diversifying over these last few years, which is great. But it still takes footwork and planning to make the numbers work unless you're a tall dude.",1636144068,mildlyinfuriating

Then a decision is made in regards to how any additional meetings will go, if any.

The basic recipe: 
  
Drain a can of chickpeas and put in your food processor. Save the liquid, though. Add tehina, lemon juice or white vinegar, ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Pulse until creamy. It will be too thick.  Add in a little of the chickpea liquid and pulse until you get the consistency you like.       

The add-ins:. At this point, it's a bit bland, but you can go a lot of different ways with the flavorings. I like to add chopped cilantro or parsely and crushed garlic.(Add herbs after blending) You can blend in hot pepper flakes, harissa, or chili paste. You can blend in a couple black olives and garnish with chopped black olives.

Yes my friend inconvenienced me, it happens. But in the op example the girl didn‚Äôt inconvenience the guy, she purposefully tried to extort something of a financial value (a paid for night out). 

In both instances the right thing to do is offer a ride home, but in both cases no one is obligated to do so. 

For me it comes down to personal responsibility, I‚Äôm responsible for my safety, ie I would have enough cash on me to get home in the even a friend let‚Äôs me down by getting drunk. The girl shouldn‚Äôt try to extort a free night out, she should have enough cash to pay for her own night and have a spare ¬£20 for a cab ride home.

Meaning i bought them the day they were dated to be expired, they weren't moldy when I bought them, but because of the date, they within a few days became quickly moldy. 

These usually last a week and a half before getting moldy. They are sealed in a box the whole time. It's not like I'm leaving them out in the open.

\- We haven't seen negative inflation in a decade, and that was the ***first and only time in 60 years we had seen negative inflation*** and by all apparent accounts we are ***more afraid of potential deflation than we are inflation***

\- Don't try comparing the economy of a largely insular America from 1932 to the an America a century later that depends ***heavily*** on external interaction and flow of capital. The estimated Gross Domestic Production per Capita of the United States back in 1930 prior to the crash was about $3,000, today its $65,000.

\- Without money moving through the economy the economy is going to stagnate. Austerity isn't going to move money into people's hands, it isn't going to fix roads, make jobs, get people buying homes and participating in the economy again. Neither is simply taxing the rich - The government taking in and holding money isn't any better than the Rich doing it. 

This is one of the ***few*** times where the mostly bullshit ""You Need To Spend Money to Make Money"" saying applies, historically austerity has ***always failed. You can't save your way out of inflation, your money is constantly losing value so you need to get it moving.***

More people working, means more people spending money at other businesses or starting new businesses, means even more people working, means even more taxable income without having to necessarily raise taxes.

Every dollar you spend, every dollar that gets spent finds its way back to the government ***eventually anyways***, and all we're doing with austerity measures is fucking ***everybody***.",1636139704,mildlyinfuriating
